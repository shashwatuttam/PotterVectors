Applying Word2Vec on Harry Potter!

## GUI
I have also made a GUI using the python library TkInter in which you can enter any word in the Harry Potter series (that occurs more than 3 times) and hit Submit and it will display the 10 most similar words predictions for both the models i.e. CBOW and Skip-Gram.

#### Running the GUI
This GUI can be run by running the file 'gui_using_tkinter.py', with the folder 'trained_HP_model' present in the same directory as the python file.
